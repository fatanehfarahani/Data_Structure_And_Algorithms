# Sorting Algorithms: An Overview
Sorting algorithms are a class of algorithms specifically designed to order the elements of a list or array in a certain sequence—typically numerical or lexicographical. They are a fundamental part of computer science, as sorting is a common operation in many applications.

## Why Sorting?
Sorting data can significantly enhance the efficiency of other algorithms (like search algorithms) that require sorted data to operate optimally. It also helps in organizing and presenting data in a way that makes sense to users.

## Classification of Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories:

•	Comparison-based sorting: These algorithms sort by comparing elements. Examples include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort.

•	Non-comparison-based sorting: These algorithms do not compare elements and instead use other operations to determine the sorted order. An example is Counting Sort.
## Key Properties
When evaluating sorting algorithms, we consider the following properties:

•	Time Complexity: How the execution time of the algorithm scales with the number of elements.

•	Space Complexity: The amount of memory the algorithm needs for its operation.

•	Stability: Whether the algorithm maintains the relative order of equal elements.

•	In-place: Whether the algorithm sorts the list without requiring extra space.
## Popular Sorting Algorithms
•	Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a ‘pivot’ element and partitions the array around it.

•	Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

•	Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

•	Counting Sort: Counts the number of objects having distinct key values and does arithmetic to calculate the position of each object
