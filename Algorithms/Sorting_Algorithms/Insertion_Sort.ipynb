        "- Average Case: In the average case, the array elements are in random order. Each element may require comparisons and shifts equal to the number of elements already sorted. This results in a time complexity of $$ O(n^2) $$.\n",
        "- Worst Case: The worst-case scenario happens when the array is sorted in reverse order. Each new element has to be compared with all the other elements already sorted. Thus, the time complexity is also $$ O(n^2) $$.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Space Complexity\n",
        "- Auxiliary Space: Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. It requires a constant amount of additional space, making the auxiliary space complexity $$ O(1) $$.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Characteristics\n",
        "- Adaptive: The time complexity can be better than $$ O(n^2) $$ if the array is partially sorted.\n",
        "- Stable: It maintains the relative order of duplicate elements.\n",
        "- In-Place: It sorts the array without using extra space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Insertion Sort is efficient for small datasets or when the array is nearly sorted. Its simplicity makes it easy to implement, but for larger datasets, more efficient algorithms are recommended due to its quadratic time complexity."
